## _Assignment 2: JavaScript/jQuery_
**View on Replit**: https://shumassn2.raymondshum.repl.co/

### **Objective:**

> To demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery in providing functionality and styling to a website.

### **Project Description:**

> This webpage hosts a space-themed slot machine game. I loosely applied the MVC design pattern to this project. The model is composed of the slot machine, which holds and updates variables associated with the "game". The "main method" in the script acts as the controller, which uses logic to determine how the View and Model are updated. jQuery is used to provide the animation effects such as the slot spin and lever pull. The user interacts with the form in the view to play the game.
